## Dataset Description:

We created an RL dataset for conversational tool-use by utilizing existing expert tool-use trajectories. We pose each assistant step of the trajectory as a separate behavior cloning problem where the policy model is incentivized to match the tool call choices of the expert model. Each trajectory includes the use of tools for authentication, data lookup, servicing (i.e. booking reservations, changing them, getting discounts, etc), and more across 838 different domains such as EdTech, IT support, travel, etc.

This dataset is released as part of NVIDIA [NeMo Gym](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym), a framework for building reinforcement learning environments to train large language models. NeMo Gym contains a growing collection of training environments and datasets to enable Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR). This dataset was utilized in the development of the [NVIDIA Nemotron](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/nemotron/) family of models.

NeMo Gym is an open-source library within the [NVIDIA NeMo framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/), NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated, end-to-end training framework for large language models (LLMs), multi-modal models, and speech models.

This dataset is part of the https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemo-gym/ collection

This dataset is ready for commercial use.
